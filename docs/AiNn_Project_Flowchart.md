AiNn Project Flowchart (Text-Based Representation)
Conventions
	• START/END: All caps, surrounded by ===
	• [Process]: Square brackets for action steps
	• <Decision>: Angle brackets for decision points, followed by Y: (Yes) and N: (No) branches
	• -->: Flow direction
	• ...>: Dotted arrow for future/planned steps
	• Notes: Italicized comments for context

Explanation of the Representation
	• Flow Simulation: 
		○ Vertical | and v show the main sequence.
		○ Horizontal --> and branches (Y:, N:) indicate decisions and their outcomes.
		○ Loops are marked with “Back to” for clarity.
	• Key Components: 
		○ AI Chat Interface: Starts the process and delivers responses.
		○ Memory Stack: Central to context retrieval, updates, and compression.
		○ Backend Data Management: Appears as a future step with a dotted arrow (...>), reflecting its planned Long term Database integration.
	• Compression Focus: Notes emphasize your current dev cycle—70% AiQ compression plus hybrid lossless approaches applied to dynamic text in [Update Memory Stack] and [Summarize and Compress].
	• Readability: Concise yet detailed, with every step and decision explicit.
